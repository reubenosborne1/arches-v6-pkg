Successive corridor chamber (I) has niches (J) and (K) and leads into rear chamber (M). The ceiling of corridor (I) has a slight barrel vault, indicating its intended use as the burial chamber. <br>QV 44 lies some meters above the shaley marl beds that have resulted in rock fracturing and loss in many of the other tombs on the south side of the valley where the marl is part of a large tilted geologic block. Unlike the majority of tombs along this branch, QV 44 is cut on a roughly east-west axis, largely perpendicular to the axes of preceding tombs, except for QV 43, whose axis it shares. Worth noting is the fact that side chamber (E) underlies ramp (A) of QV 43, with approximately two meters of rock in between. <br>The walls and ceilings of this tomb are extremely regular indicating that the rock substrate is of high quality and did not require the substantial amount of infill material as seen in many of the other tombs in QV though current condition of the rock surface in many areas is hidden by widespread plaster repairs. The visible rock throughout the tomb is in relatively good condition with a large amount of extant decoration, and does not show the natural jointing deterioration from swelling pressure changes related to underlying shale. <br>Extensive sunken relief painted plaster survives throughout the tomb on walls and ceilings in excellent condition. After QV 66, this tomb has the best preserved painted decoration in the valley. Its decoration is in various stages of completion; side chamber (K) in second corridor (I) was not completely excavated while side chamber (J) was cut and plastered with a base plaster; doorway (H) is also unfinishedG+ç+¦the plaster was carved but not painted. Entrance (B) and doorway (H) are thought to have been widened at a later date to accommodate the large granite sarcophagus. The doorways were replastered and carved but were never painted. It is possible that the side chambers of the first corridor may also be unfinished as the paintings are lacking the final detailing that can be seen in corridors (C) and (I). The paintings have been extensively treated and large modern repair plasters are present throughout the tomb. <br>The tomb was discovered by E. Schiaparelli in February 1903. At the time of discovery, the tomb was littered with mummies and wooden sarcophagi dated to the late 22nd-26th dynasties of the Third Intermediate Period, a period of apparent substantial reuse. A dry masonry wall apparently sealed the entrance after these burials and, lacking evidence of Roman re-use, the entrance is assumed to have been lost and forgotten by that time. <br>The tomb was re-opened and probably pillaged during the Coptic and Arabic periods. Desert scavengers (perhaps hyenas) were noted by the Italian mission to have ravaged some of the human remains. A pit excavated in the floor of chamber (I) to receive the sarcophagus (measured 7.90m++¦ 3.10m by F. Hassanein and M. Nelson 1997) had been filled with sand since discovery. <br>C. Leblanc has noted that a small amount of floodwater entered the tomb in November 1994 (C. Leblanc, pers. comm., 2009). <br>Currently the tomb is open to visitation. Glass barriers, fluorescent lighting, and wooden flooring are installed. Previously, low wooden barriers were used. A sturdy metal door seals and locks the tomb when the site is closed.

2bff4ead-85e0-4fb1-9ea7-2a0fc4ee4e34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The tomb has a simple floor plan with only two chambers roughly on a north-south axis with tomb entrance. The tomb is entered through steep, stepped ramp (A) and doorway (B) leading to a plastered but unfinished main chamber (C) and a roughly hewn, unplastered rear chamber (E). Ramp steps are constructed of boulders. Each wall in chamber (C) has a magical niche. <br>Entrance ramp (A) passes through the heavily jointed and fractured marl stratum similar to other tombs on the south side of the valley. However, in rear chamber (E), the south wall, and the rear parts of the side walls, ceiling and floor are cut out of a shale stratum, which present recent localized areas of loss. Tomb floor is rough cut and appears partly unfinished. <br>Extensive unfinished painted plaster survives on the walls and parts of the ceiling in main chamber (C) but the decoration on the lower third of walls has been lost. The surface of surviving areas of painted plaster is irregular most likely due to the uneven nature of the underlying rock substrate. There are two plaster layers identifiable on walls of chamber (C), including a lower leveling layer of an earth and straw containing plaster and an upper plaster that is whitish-gray in color. The upper plaster layer has a rough surface texture with brush strokes visible. No ground layer was subsequently applied and no relief carving was undertaken. <br>As the final painting was never completed this tomb provides insight of preliminary painting practice. Preparatory techniques such as red snapped lines and underdrawing in black and red are visible on the walls. The paintings were initially sketched out with fluid, cursory, thick red outlining often showing mistakes and corrections; followed by more detailed and corrective black outlining. The ceiling is decorated with a rough wash of blue-black paint with a large figure of the goddess Nut boldly blocked out in yellow with red outlines. It does not appear as if the rear chamber (E) was ever plastered or painted. <br>QV 38 is the oldest decorated tomb in QV constructed in the 19th Dynasty and the oldest 'corridor' type tomb whose owner is identified, according to E. Thomas and C. Leblanc. Thomas suggests that the epithet 'Great Royal Mother' indicates that the decoration, if not the tomb as a whole, was the responsibility of her son, Seti I. Similarly, its incompletion in construction and decoration may indicate that she did not long survive her husband, Rameses I, whose tomb (KV 16) was also unfinished (Thomas 1966, 213). Unusually, chamber (C) ultimately served as the burial chamber, as evidenced by the presence of magical brick niches, and the fact that the burial chamber was never fully excavated. <br>The tomb has been accessible since the time of J. G. Wilkinson (1828) and was subsequently recorded by J. F. Champollion (1829), K. R. Lepsius (1844), and H. K. Brugsch (1854). The tomb was later cleared by the Italian mission in 1903-05. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation. The doorway is reconstructed of fired brick and cement plaster, with a metal grill door with mesh installed within a wooden frame. The mesh has a large hole in it. Fragments of painted plaster from an unknown location (not from this tomb), other archaeological material, as well as the Italian mission plaque, which was once mounted on the walls of the entrance ramp, are now stored in chamber (E). Evidence of bat activity includes bat droppings and urine on the rear wall and ceiling of rear chamber (E).",Primary,,,,,,,,,access point,Chamber Tomb,REIGN OF SETI I,,,,,,,,,,,,QV 38,Primary,,"QV 38 is located halfway up the southwest branch of the wadi, adjacent to the main pathway and retaining wall.",,/files/uploadedfiles/QV38_TMP_drawing_1.jpg,Archaeological Site Element,,GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (32.59257515993576 25.72692278811163)),-1295~/-1294~,Built Date,,,,,,

The tomb is cut primarily into shale, recognizable by its color, quality, and salt veins. A modern brick surround plastered in cement is present at the entrance, spanned with a metal grill. <br>The tomb was first discovered and excavated in modern times by Schiaparelli, and is thought to be thought to be the oldest shaft-style tomb in the valley. Although pillaged and flooded in antiquity, the tomb retained enough material to reveal an originally rich burial and the name Ahmose, identified as the King's sister and daughter of Seqenenre Tao. Schiaparelli presumed that the mummy of a relatively tall person of advanced age was that of the princess.  The lack of canopic jars puzzled Schiaparelli, given the remains of a canopic chest and the fact that these are often recovered in previously pillaged tombs. Thomas notes that Ahmose was probably buried by Thutmosis I, but burial may have taken place under Ahmose or Amenhotep I (see Tomb Profile in Historic Overview).

On axis with the entrance, a stepped ramp runs through a small intermediate chamber (E), leading into the vaulted burial chamber (G) which originally contained two constructed pillars, one of which has since collapsed. A later pit (J) which continues to a small lower chamber (K) was cut into the burial chamber floor. Remains of mud brick walls survive to the east of doorway (D). A similar construction at doorway (B) once existed but is no longer extant. <br>The ramp and chambers are cut out of highly weathered marl as found in other adjacent tombs on the northern side of the valley, but above the tomb entrance the paleofan conglomerate layer is largely missing and was likely removed in recent decades. <br>Generally, the interior rock quality was good, allowing the tomb walls to be cut fairly straight. However, infilling with rock shards and plaster was still needed in localized areas. The walls were prepared with two layers of plaster including an earthen-based lower layer followed by a very thin upper plaster layer. Floors are roughly cut throughout the tomb and may be unfinished. <br>Extensive raised relief painted plaster survives throughout the tomb in fragmentary condition. This also includes remnants of plaster on walls of ramp (A) and small areas of painted plaster on both sides of doorway (B). <br>There is fire-related blackening and heat-related deterioration, though the overall blackening is not as severe as in other tombs. <br>The tomb was constructed in the 19th dynasty for a princess but was later usurped by Queen Duatentipet in the 20th dynasty. This is evidenced by the replacement of the existing titles of  princess with the Queen's title to reflect the new occupier (Leblanc and Abdel-Rahman 1991, 159-164). During the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, the tomb was reused as a communal burial and pit (J) was cut. Remnants of mud brick walls were recorded by CNRS in 1985 on doorway (B). <br>and on the east jamb of doorway (D), though the former is no longer extant. Both were built as later additions in the Roman period (Leblanc 1991). The tomb has been accessible at least since the time of R.

Chamber (C) leads to burial chamber (I) and a rear niche (K) on axis with the tomb entrance. A sunken pit in the center of the burial chamber accommodated the sarcophagus. There is also a smaller pit to the west. Three small magical niches exist on the north, west and east walls of the burial chamber. <br>The marl into which the ramp is cut is tilted and heavily weathered and jointed. The bedrock is covered by a thin debris fan (paleofanglomerate) containing loosely cemented large boulders, similar to the other adjacent tombs in the north side of the valley. Burial chamber (I) and niche (K) provide an indication of the condition of the rock in this tomb as they are the only rooms with exposed rock. In general, the tomb does not present any major structural concerns. <br>Generally, the poor quality of the rock in this tomb required packing of walls with plaster and stone shards in order to create a flat surface for the decoration.

Two side chambers lie to the east (G) and west (E). Below side chamber (E) is a lower chamber (N) which had a barrel-vaulted ceiling, now collapsed. Chamber (N) is  accessible through stepped ramp (M) located in the southwest corner of chamber (C). A small stepped ramp (H), on axis with entrance ramp (A), leads to burial chamber (J) with a large rear niche (L) to the north. A sunken pit in the center of the chamber (J) accommodated the sarcophagus; rock-cut benches line the north and south walls; the south bench is in two parts with a shallow pit dug in-between. There are small magical brick niches in each wall of the burial chamber (J). <br>Ramp (A) is cut into heavily weathered marl of the lower part of Member I, similar to the adjacent tombs on the north side of the valley. Above the marl of the entrance, a layer of debris fan conglomerate containing large boulders is present, similar to the adjacent tombs. There is a substantial amount of surviving original plaster on the ramp walls. <br>Rock in this tomb is generally of good quality so it did not require a substantial amount of packing of wall surfaces as seen in many other tombs in the valley. However, a notably thick plaster stratigraphy was still used, which included a lower, earth-based layer. This was followed by a thin lighter-colored upper plaster layer. An additional third plaster layer is visible, but only in some areas. Doorways were constructed from stone rubble and covered with a thick application of plaster. The ceiling of chamber (C), unlike the walls, was left irregular but was still plastered and painted with stars. The floor is roughly cut in side chambers (G, E). <br>There is extensive surviving decoration on the walls and ceiling of tomb QV 71, though the raised relief decoration exhibits severe fire-related blackening and heat damage. <br>The tomb was reused in the Third Intermediate Period and probably again during the Roman period for burial since a terracotta sarcophagus is recorded in the tomb by R. Hay of Linplum. The base of the wall in the burial chamber looks to have been replastered in antiquity which may also indicate later reuse of the tomb. <br>The tomb has been accessible at least since the time of Hay of Linplum (1826) who noted that the access to chamber (N) could not be located as the vaulted ceiling had collapsed. Most recently the tomb was cleared by the CNRS French team in 1971-72. There are trays of wall plaster fragments stored in chamber (C) which appear to be from QV 66 and from other unknown locations. Discarded carpets also from QV 66 are piled up on the floor of the tomb which still conceals some mummy remains. TMP noted that the central part of the ceiling of chamber (C) partly collapsed during original construction and was then plaster and painted. <br>Doorway (B) has been reconstructed out of fired brick and cement with a metal grill door with no mesh.  A small area of painting survives on the door jamb. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation. Evidence of bat activity includes extensive droppings on the floor throughout the tomb as well as white crystalline deposits. A bird nest was seen on west jamb of doorway (H).

A niche is present in the middle of the south wall of the chamber and a side chamber (G) is located to the west, off the burial chamber. <br>As with the other tombs on the south side of the valley, the marl is part of a large tilted geologic block, evidenced by the angle of the bedding planes visible in the tomb.  Unlike many of the 19th dynasty tombs on the south side of the valley, the rock is in relatively good condition and does not show damage from swelling pressure changes related to underlying layers of shale, except in a few localized areas. <br>The rock walls and ceilings of this tomb were cut relatively straight and flat. Only localized areas of rock voids and collapse contemporary with original construction required infill with stone shards and large amounts of plaster to create a flat surface for the painting. Generally two plaster layers were applied, the thickness depending on the quality of the underlying rock. <br>In a few areas, where the rock was in particularly poor condition, instead of using infill material walls were constructed with stone or mud brick in order to create a flat vertical surface. The east side of the north wall of funerary chamber (E) has been almost entirely constructed out of mud brick.  The painting technique differs in this area with no relief work and a slightly cruder painting style. <br>An extensive amount of sunken relief painted plaster survives throughout the tomb. Areas without decoration include side chamber (G), and the inner face of doorway (D), which were plastered but not painted, and the inner face of doorway (F), which have carved plaster that may never has been painted. <br>The tomb has been accessible since the time of Robert Hay of Linplum (1826) and is included in subsequent visitor records.  According to Elizabeth Thomas, the tomb is the oldest of the 20th dynasty tombs and the last to appear in the valley with pillars. It was probably usurped by Rameses III as a tomb for his son, though originally meant for a queen, as evidenced by a scene in the decoration and the sarcophagus found there by Schiaparelli. Thomas suggests that the different technique (which she wrongly calls 'fresco') for the sole painted scene with the queen may have been due to a lack of time, although observation suggests this may instead be due to the reconstructed wall behind. Thomas also notes the presence of hieratic graffiti on the left wall of corridor (C) and suggests that the niche to the rear of the burial chamber was added later. <br>Currently, the tomb is not open to visitation and a metal grill door with detached, failing mesh prevents access. In November 2008, plastic sheeting was attached over the door by the SCA to prevent bat and bird entry.

At this time he noted that '[t]he rubble, which had fallen upon [it] and had filled the stairs, had also entered in the first chamber [chamber (C)], where it piled up near the entrance, near the left wall and near the one in the back, almost touching the ceiling. The other chambers were almost empty; but their floor was evenly coated with a thick layer of soil, brought in by rain waters, which must have infiltrated the tomb repeatedly' (Schiaparelli 1923, 53-55). <br>A survey benchmark (in the form of a metal disk) indicating elevation above mean sea level is embedded in the brick entrance to the tomb.

7cbf5664-f649-4992-9bc5-92497a240fd7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This tomb is entered through a short ramp (A), once stepped, leading into chamber (C) with two constructed pillars remaining. North of this chamber, a short ramp runs through a small intermediate chamber (E) that contains a deep vertical shaft (H) which leads to a small lower chamber (I). On axis with the entrance, the ramp then continues into the burial chamber (G) which originally contained four masonry constructed pillars; the northeast one is now collapsed. Remains of a later small stone structure, possibly a wall, survive in the southwest corner of this room. <br>The ramp (A) is cut out of heavily weathered marl similar to other adjacent tombs in this part of the north side of the valley. There is no paleofan debris layer over the tomb, contrary to the adjacent tombs, which seems to have been removed for unknown reasons before the 1980s. Marl in the tomb contains many salt veins and fractures. <br>Generally, the interior rock quality is good which allowed the tomb walls to be cut fairly straight. However, infilling with rock shards and plaster was still needed in localized areas. The walls were prepared with a lower earthen-based layer followed by one or two upper finishing layers. The tomb floor is roughly cut and appears to be unfinished. <br>Large but fragmentary areas of raised relief painting and lower plaster layers survive throughout the tomb on walls, ceiling and remaining pillars. The paintings show evidence of severe heat-related damages but only some fire-blackening. <br>The tomb was robbed and vandalized more than once in the late 20th Dynasty by Paneb and others. The queen's sarcophagus was reused in the 22nd Dynasty and the tomb in the Roman period. <br>The tomb has been accessible at least since the time of R. Hay of Linplum (1826), as he recorded the poor condition of the tomb and the 'apparent omission of the owner's name' (Thomas 1966, p.218). E. Thomas noted that although the wall paintings in chamber (G) suffered fire damage, they were better preserved than in chamber (C) where salts affected the painting condition more than fire. TMP (1981) drawings record steps on ramp (A) which are now substantially damaged and are only still preserved along the ramp sides. Most recently the tomb was cleared by the French in 1984, and between 1986-87. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation. A low boulder wall partially blocks the entrance doorway. There is no door on this tomb. <br>This tomb has had extensive bat activity with crystalline deposits on the surface of the wall paintings and droppings found throughout. Bats were also noted during the February 2008 inspection. The location of the crystalline deposits indicates that the bats tend to roost directly on the upper edges of the paintings.

Chamber (C) is followed by a corridor chamber (G) with a side chamber (I) to the north. Corridor (G) then leads into rear chamber (K) which contains a granite sarcophagus and a glass case with a mummified fetus. The fetus was not originally from this tomb but was found in the Valley of Prince Ahmose by the Italian mission. <br>The tomb is cut out of the same grayish-colored, chert-rich marl found in this part of the valley. The rock is generally of good quality in this tomb, so it did not require the substantial amount of infill material as seen in many of the other tombs in QV. However, the rock condition is difficult to fully assess because of the extensive modern repairs carried out  throughout the tomb. Some original rock is visible in the ramp side wall, as is some original plaster and packing, and in side chamber (E). <br>Extensive sunken relief painted plaster survives throughout the tomb, though once evidently boldly colored, the general appearance is now abraded and the colors appear somewhat faded. Areas of the tomb decoration are unfinished including side chamber (E) that was plastered but was never painted, as well as rear chamber (K) that has a base plaster layer only. The ceiling may also have not been completed, with only a single wash of black paint applied. <br>E. Schiaparelli discovered the tomb in 1904. Part of the plastered, dry masonry wall which originally sealed the entrance was still preserved but the tomb was found empty, apart from a sarcophagus in chamber (G). E. Thomas notes that the entrance had been re-sealed with plaster after thieves had broken through. G. Lecuyot suggests the tomb location was lost during the Third Intermediate Period. The Italian mission constructed surround walls and a vaulted cover over the entrance and added a metal door. Most recently, the CNRS team carried out investigations in the tomb in 1988. <br>Currently the tomb is open to visitation except for side chambers (E) and (I) that are closed off to visitors. Glass barriers, fluorescent lighting, and wooden flooring are installed. Previously, low wooden barriers were used. There are no barriers around doorway (J) and in burial chamber (K).

The two pillars were originally constructed of stone masonry after the ceiling was already plastered and painted. Only the easternmost pillar still survives. <br>As with the other tombs on the south side of the valley, the marl stratum into which this tomb is cut is part of a large tilted geologic block. Extensive modern repairs throughout the tomb does not allow for direct observation of the rock. <br>Extensive raised relief painted plaster survives on the walls and ceilings in all chambers of the tomb though there are many areas of loss. The paintings have been extensively treated and all areas of loss filled with modern plaster repairs. The paintings in side chamber (G) are painted on a larger scale and in a cruder style with a more limited palette (red, black, yellow and white) compared with other areas of the tomb and may therefore be unfinished. Small traces of original infill material and upper plaster also survive on the walls of entrance ramp (A). <br>This tomb has been accessible since the time of R. Hay of Linplum (1826), who described the tomb and a single pillar in his notes, the remains of the second pillar presumably buried in debris. E. Schiaparelli cleared the tomb during the Italian mission work at the site (1903-05). E. Thomas notes that the ceiling vault is the first example of this type in QV and the two pillars are the only 19th Dynasty pillars on the south side of the wadi, and that the layout of this tomb is distinct from that of its predecessors. K. R. Lepsius recorded the presence of a hieratic graffito in chamber (C), dated to the Rameses III reign. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation, though it was open from an unknown date until 2000. Cement steps in ramp (A) were built on top of original rock cut steps which are still visible at sides. Lights have been placed (though not installed) in the tomb and six cement blocks for mounting lighting units are scattered throughout the tomb. The entrance (B) wasrebuilt (date unknown) with fired brick and covered in a cementitious plaster with a wooden door with metal grills and mesh installed in a wooden frame.

A small chamber or niche (O) lies to the west of rear chamber (M) and was sealed with a masonry wall covered in plaster that has since partially collapsed. To the east of chamber (M) is a shaft (P) which leads to lower chamber (Q). <br>Unlike many of the 19th Dynasty tombs on the south side of the valley, the marl rock into which this 20th Dynasty tomb was cut is in relatively good condition. It is not heavily  jointed and there are no localized losses due to swelling pressure changes related to underlying layers of shale when in contact with water. <br>This tomb is only plastered and the decoration was never completed. The rock walls were generally cut flat and straight and then coated with a rough base plaster that contained small rock shards, though in localized areas large voids in the rock still required infilling with larger rock shards and plaster. Other areas of the tomb were constructed out of mud brick, perhaps in areas where the rock condition was poor, in order to create a flat surface for the decoration. According to C. Leblanc the tomb was not occupied in pharaonic times. The evidence of fire in this tomb could suggest later re-use of the tomb. <br>A significant amount of soot blackened plaster remains on the long corridor walls and ceiling. The west wall of the rear chamber, side chambers and niches were not plastered.

There is a rear niche (G) and two side chambers off the east (I) and west (K) sides of the burial chamber. Side chamber (I) has a shallow excavated trench along its south wall. <br>The orientation of the tomb along a roughly north-south axis is distinct from nearby QV 52, 53 and 55. The tomb was cut out of the tilted marl block, grayish in color, and similar to the adjacent tombs in this part of the valley. <br>Walls were cut very straight and flat in the corridor indicating good quality of the rock substrate. There is fine tooling of the stone visible in this area. The quality of the rock generally worsens toward the rear of the tomb where sizeable voids required infilling with substantial quantities of rock shards and plaster. The ceiling also required plaster and rock infill. Two plaster layers are visible: a lower earth-containing layer and an upper lighter colored layer. Hand marks in the ceiling plaster indicate the application method. In areas were the rock was able to be finely carved, only a thin skim of plaster was applied before painting; in some cases you can see the surface of the rock substrate showing through. <br>There is fragmentary survival of the refined sunken relief painted plaster in corridor (C) and in burial chamber (E). Side chambers (I, K) have preliminary painting in red with no relief-work and look unfinished; the paintings appear hastily painted and are much cruder than the refined paintings found in the corridor and burial chamber. The east side of chamber (I) also has an area of rock that was not fully excavated. The ceiling of the corridor is also unfinished with only the northeast corner started with preliminary red painting. The tomb exhibits severe fire-related heat damage but little blackening. <br>Soon after the burial the tomb was opened by robbers in the late 20th dynasty. In modern history, the tomb has been accessible since the time of R. Hay of Linplum (1826) and was recorded subsequently by other researchers. According to Hay, the tomb was 'much destroyed and filled with rubbish' and the back wall broken in search of finding a chamber. E. Schiaparelli cleared the tomb of debris during the Italian mission work in the valley (1903-1905). He considered it to be the last tomb constructed in the valley as a cartouche of Rameses VI was found in doorway (D). E. Thomas notes that many sarcophagus fragments remained, as they do today in the tomb, scattered throughout corridor (C) and burial chamber (E). <br>Thomas also compared the quality of the decoration in chamber (C), doorway (D), and the rear of chamber (E) to that of QV 52, calling the rest poor in quality. She further suggests that the work, overseen by Rameses VI for his mother, was interrupted and hastily finished, based primarily on the crudeness of the decoration in the side chambers. The tomb was last cleared by the Franco-Egyptian team in 1986. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation and bears an old sign that reads 'closed for restoration' already visible in photographs from 1988.

Two side chambers (I) and (K) lie off of the burial chamber (E) on a northwest-southeast axis. A shaft (L) in floor of chamber (I) connects to a pit (M). <br>The orientation of the tomb along a southwest-northeast axis is distinct from QV 51, but similar to that of QV 53 and 55. The tomb was cut out of the tilted marl block, grayish in color and full of chert, similar to the adjacent tombs in this part of the valley. <br>The high quality of the rock substrate in this tomb allowed for extremely fine stone working. Tomb walls could be cut flat and straight, unlike many other tombs in QV, and only required filling with packing plaster along rock fissures. In general, only a very thin layer of plaster was necessary to prepare the rock surface for painting. At the entrance of the tomb, on the south jamb of doorway (B), the rock carving was so fine that the painting was even applied directly onto the stone without a plaster layer. <br>There is extensive sunken relief painted plaster that survives throughout the tomb, though the general appearance is now abraded and the colors appear faded. The setting-out technique of using black, snapped lines is evident on the ceiling that is painted with white stars. The paintings have been previously treated and all areas of loss have been filled with modern plaster repairs. <br>The tomb was reused during the Third Intermediate Period when pit (M) was thought to be added, as many artifacts dated to that period were found in the pit, according to S.M. Sayed and A. Sesana (1995, 218) The tomb has long been easily accessible in modern history. Giovanni Battista Belzoni left a graffito with his name and date in the tomb in 1816, probably in doorway (D), but it is now presumably hidden by modern infill plaster. Robert Hay of Linplum considered QV 52 to be 'the most perfect' tomb (Thomas 1966, 223). He visited QV in 1826 and noted that chamber (C) was full of debris to a height of one third of the walls. <br>G. A. B+-¼n+-¼dite notes (1893) that the ceiling of the corridor was covered with yellow stars on a white background. He also recorded that the floor of the corridor (C) was significantly inclined toward the rear of the tomb (the gap of height was approx. 55 cm). Presumably substantial amount of debris covered the floor. <br>The tomb was known but was not cleared until 1903 by E. Schiaparelli. C. Campbell notes in 1909 that none of the depictions of the queen in the paintings was left preserved. Elizabeth Thomas records that the tomb and decoration appear complete, created without haste and the general state of preservation to be good. She further notes that several walls were damaged by treasure hunters. Most recently, the French CNRS-CEDAE team excavated in chambers (E) and (I), including lower pit (M), in 1994. <br>Currently the tomb is open to visitation. Wooden flooring and fluorescent lighting have been installed throughout the tomb. Glass barriers line the walls except around doorways (F) and (H).

The tomb is entered through steep ramp (A) leading into pillared chamber (C) with barrel vault and eastern side chamber (G); another small side chamber (E) lies to the northwest and connects to rear side chamber (L). On axis with the entrance to the tomb, doorway (H) leads to a central chamber (I), with northern niche (J) and access to large chamber (N_P) and side chamber (L). In its present condition, the tomb has only the two portions of walls extant, on either side of the central axis doorway (H). All the chambers presently connect and can be accessed at multiple points not originally intended. <br>The marl has tilted bedding planes with bands of chert nodules and open joints and faults sometimes filled with gypsum/anhydrite and exhibiting adjacent efflorescence and large crystal growth. Loosely cemented paleofan debris or colluvium above the bedrock is a later deposit suggesting early exposure of the bedrock and continued weathering because of water infiltration, particularly at the entrance, where the marl roof is only 1.5m thick and overlain by 1-2m of colluvium. <br>Leblanc has noted that the tomb flooded in 1994, and remaining evidence of that event and prior flooding includes a layer of dried mud on the floor, floodwater marks on the walls, and corresponding deteriorated rock below the floodwater lines. A 1993 geotechnical study recorded six or seven different deposition layers within over 1 meter of sediment accumulated against the north side of the wall between chamber (C) and chamber (I), indicating that the tomb has experienced at least that many flood episodes in its history. Elizabeth Thomas and Christian Leblanc have also noted the presence of thick sediment throughout the tomb. <br>Wooden post and beam shoring is present in two locations in rear chamber (N_P), extending west across the collapsed wall of doorways (M) and (O) and into adjacent chamber (I).  The shoring was erected in the 1980's in response to the observed ceiling fractures and areas of significant loss of ceiling rock and internal rock wall. Gypsum/white cement mortar has also been applied to fill gaps between the beams and the ceiling rock and in several fractures in the rock. <br>Raised relief painting survives throughout the tomb but has suffered significant losses. The walls were packed out with infill material consisting of earth-based plaster and rock shards to create a flat surface for the paintings. The plastering technique differs throughout the tomb with multiple layers employed in some areas, generally thickly applied. <br>This tomb has surviving areas of Coptic painting and replastering over the Pharaonic paintings.  Painted on the east wall of the antechamber (C) are two crosses.  The Coptic plaster is characterized by a high earth content. <br> The tomb was cleared by the Franco-Egyptian team in 1981-83, but has been accessible since the time of Robert Hay of Linplum (1826). It was already largely damaged in Hay's time and Elizabeth Thomas notes sediment throughout the tomb. The absence of pillars, thought to have been removed during the Coptic period to create a ceremonial space, was noted with confusion by Hay. Further evidence of Coptic reuse includes graffiti in the tomb, external mudbrick structures, and fired brick pavers outside the tomb. In relation to the extensive amount of extant pharaonic painting, Thomas notes their brilliance and compares their quality to those of Nefertari (QV66). <br>The tomb is not open to visitation.

A large chamber (E) is located to the east of chamber (C), and a small niche (G) to the south is on axis with the stepped entry ramp (A).  The tomb plan intersects the earlier excavated shaft tombs of QV 87 on the east, and QV 35 on the south.  Two partially preserved rubble masonry pillars stand in the middle of main chamber (C).  The rock roof of the main chamber collapsed in antiquity according to archaeologists' findings, leaving the tomb exposed and open to the environment. The original ceiling vault is evident from its remains on the north side of the east wall. Large metal and wooden shoring is present in chambers (C) and (E). As with its neighbors, QV 33 and QV 36, this tomb is cut into the lowermost part of Theban Member I, which contains marl bedrock above a bed of shale that is possibly the upper portion of the Esna formation. The shale is evident in side chamber (E), along with a fault plane that lies between the two rock types. The marl bedrock is tilted and heavily jointed as a result of its proximity to the shale. The joint planes immediately below the overlying colluvium show marked curvature, indicating prior movement due to downhill soil creep long before the original excavation of the tombs.  A thin layer of colluvium covers the bedrock at the surface.<br>Two steel raking shores have been installed to support the upper portion of the south wall of the main chamber, where a large open vertical E-W oriented fracture exists behind the face of the wall, while wooden post and beam shoring supports the undercut south wall of side chamber (E).  A dry rubble wall has been erected in doorway (D) to prevent access to the side chamber, and two wooden horizontal braces support the rock of the internal partition wall. <br>Remnant decoration in this tomb includes both incised plaster and raised relief painting. All wall faces, except in the side chamber, contain very thick layers of infill material of earth-based plaster and rock shards to create flat surfaces for the decoration due to the poor quality of the rock. Traces of plaster still survive on walls and pillars, but little surface decoration remains.  Extensive losses have occurred since 1989, as seen in the CEDAE photographs. <br>The tomb was cleared by the French-Egyptian team in 1987-88 and no records of prior excavation or visitation have been uncovered. E. Thomas notes that QV34 was not discernible at the time of her visit (1960s), but she records the presence of debris fill and an irregular saddle-shaped ceiling in her description of QV 35, which most likely refers to the collapsed ceiling of QV 34.  She suggests that this tomb may relate to a Schiaparelli discovery that was then backfilled out of safety concerns. <br>Although officially closed to visitation, the tomb lacks any means of physical closure or barrier to the entrance, though a low rubble wall at the top of the ramp is meant to deter entry. An additional rubble wall has been constructed between the main chamber (C) and side chamber (E).

Smaller rear and side chambers lie to the north (E) and east (G). Elizabeth Thomas suggests the plan was cut short, given that the general layout is similar to many of the preceding tombs. <br>As with the rest of the main wadi, the bedding planes are tilted. The tomb is shallow and the rock into which it is cut is heavily weathered and jointed and covered by a 2-3 meter thick partially cemented debris fan. The tomb is heavily jointed, with the presence of faults. Some joints are open, while others have salt infills. <br>The rock substrate is roughly carved and irregular (because of the poor quality of the rock) requiring a thick plaster application and use of rock shards to pack out the walls to create a flat surface for the painting. Door jambs appear to be built up with masonry rather than cut from the rock.  Pillars were also constructed, built up after the ceiling was already plastered and painted.  Red mason marks are still visible on exposed rock in a few areas. <br>Two layers of plaster were generally applied on to the infill material:  a coarse plaster followed by a fine plaster layer. All chambers were decorated with raised relief painted plaster, though the paintings in side chamber (G) appear cruder and less refined than in chambers (C) and (E).  Note that plaster remains on small area of steps in ramp (A). <br>In chamber (C) a significant amount of the infill and coarse plaster survives but it is the upper painted plaster layer that is fragmentary and has suffered substantial losses. More painted plaster survives in side chambers (E) and (G) though these areas are also quite fragmentary. <br>There is evidence of overplastering of the Pharaonic paintings throughout the tomb, characterized by an earth and straw-containing plaster used to fill holes in the wall and to cover over the paintings.  This plaster has since been removed though not very thoroughly, as traces of the plaster are still visible in many areas. In chamber (C) an unknown wash was applied to the ceiling perhaps as an early restoration attempt.  This wash was carried out sometime in antiquity before loss of the pillars. <br>The tomb has been accessible since the time of Robert Hay of Linplum (1826) and was most recently cleared by the French CNRS team in 1984.  Hay thought the overplastering or 'mud' that coated the paintings took some of the paint layer with it as it fell.  Elizabeth Thomas notes that far more decoration may be protected beneath the overplastering and suggested Henuttauy as tomb attribution based on a partial cartouche, though it was the French who confirmed this after removal of the earthen overplastering. Thomas also notes the localized smoke evidence in an eye-level hole on the right of doorway (D), which she suggests might be from candle-burning related to Coptic ceremony. Christian Leblanc states that the extent of finds related to different periods suggests extensive reuse of the tomb throughout the Third Intermediate, Roman, and Coptic periods, the latter representing the period during which the Pharaonic paintings were covered over with mud. <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation.  Entry is prevented by a metal grill door with no mesh. Two bird nests sit in the large hanging rock ledge in the ceiling of chamber (C) and the presence of a bird has been noted during in situ inspections.

The tombs were last cleared by the Franco-Egyptian team in 1987 (QV 15) and 1985-86 (QV 16).

Chamber (E) proceeds along the central tomb axis to chamber (K), with a large side chamber (M) to the west that has a small niche (O) to its south. Remains of a mudbrick structure are present in doorway (D). <br>The tomb was cut into the marls of the middle part of Member I, still part of the large tilted geologic block that composes much of the valley.  The angle of tilt is visible in the lines of chert lenses present within this part of the marl.  The rock is in relatively good condition and is easily worked, though it has suffered from periodic flooding, resulting in localized ceiling and wall falls. Its grey color compared to the yellower marls elsewhere in the valley reveal the higher clay content of the rock in this part of the valley. A fault runs through the rear of the tomb, and much of the chert throughout the tomb is crushed or brecciated, reflecting the rotational movement that has occurred with the rock. <br>Evidence of recent flooding is visible throughout the tomb in the form of horizontal water marks and basal erosion along walls, and a thick layer of dried, cracked mud on the floor of the chambers, especially those farthest from the entrance. Leblanc records that during the 1994 flood water filled the tomb up to the mid-level of its walls (Leblanc 1995, 212). Elizabeth Thomas noted that the tomb was half full of debris upon her visit in 1959-60, suggesting a long history of periodic flooding. <br>The tomb has little extant decoration, although the full extent of surviving plaster and painting has not yet been properly recorded or studied. The small areas of remaining sunken relief plaster in chamber (C) are the main areas of surviving painted decoration in the tomb.

Chamber (G) lies on axis with the tomb and opens to rear chamber (I) and southeast side chamber (K). A shallow pit in the south corner of chamber (K) leads to a small opening into the rock, perhaps the beginnings of a tunnel, denoted by (L). <br>As with the other tombs on the south side of the valley, the marl into which this tomb is cut is part of a large tilted geologic block, the orientation of which can be determined from the diagonal chert layers and perpendicular open joints evident in CEDAE images taken in 1977, prior to repairs. Unlike the majority of tombs along this branch, the tomb is cut on a roughly east-west axis, largely perpendicular to the axes of preceding tombs Extensive sunken relief painting survives on the walls in corridors and chambers except for chamber (K) which is undecorated. The decoration at the rear end of the second corridor (E), in chamber (G) and in rear chamber (I) are unfinished; the reliefs are roughly executed and not painted, though this is difficult to fully assess because of the level of fire blackening and aggressive cleaning that has been undertaken. The walls are generally flat and straight in the corridors though a few large areas of loss suggest that substantial infill material was necessary to fill voids in the rock. This is difficult to evaluate because of the large modern repair plasters that have been carried out throughout the tomb. The walls and ceiling in the rear chambers are more uneven but have excellent survival of plaster. Walls were either packed with masonry fill in preparation for decoration (as in corridor (C)) or simply plastered and painted over, as in chamber (G), where a large concave area of the ceiling was left. Generally, there are two-layers of plastering including a lower coarse layer and an upper fine layer. <br>This tomb was rediscovered by the Italian mission in February 1903, ten days after the discovery of adjacent QV 44. E. Thomas notes complete blackening of the tomb, general loss of plaster, relief on the lower portions of walls, and presence of wasp nests on the upper parts of walls. She suggests the hole in side chamber (K) and beginnings of tunnel (L) were the 'work of a treasure seeker' (1966, p. 220). E. Schiaparelli indicated that the tomb was likely accessible from the 22nd to 26th Dynasties, given the large amount of sarcophagi, mummies, and related artifacts found therein. The lack of an original sarcophagus caused him to question whether the tomb was originally used, though the sarcophagus may have been removed. C. Leblanc also believes that the tomb was never occupied and that the addition of side niche (K) is a possible sign of reuse. Additionally, F. Ballerini noted that hyenas had apparently ravaged the tomb, devouring some of the mummies and that the walls were all blackened caused by fire. <br>The tomb has been periodically opened to visitation from approximately 1993 to 2000 and again in November 2009.

Shales are evident at the base of entrance ramp (A), the floor and base of walls in burial chamber (E), as well as in lower chamber (H).  The shales present in chambers (E) and (H) reveal the contact between the two geological units (Member I and Esna Shale), while those in ramp (A) may represent a displacement within the Esna Shale. A fault plane is present within ramp (A), revealing internal displacement near the Member I/Esna shale contact of approximately 5-10m. According to R. W++st, this fault plane and the Member I/Esna Shale contact within the tomb are crucial to understanding the geology and structural complexity of the entire valley, pointing to the fault plane on which the entire rotated block of the valley slipped and fluidized the shale beneath it. Heavy jointing of the marl is present throughout the tomb, as a result of the different lithologies and cycle of overpressure and pressure relief related to wetting and drying of the shale. <br>Only very small and fragmentary areas of raised relief painting survive at the tops of the walls and ceiling of main chamber (C). The plaster was thickly applied with rock shards mixed in to pack out the wall and create a flat surface for the paintings.  The paintings are blackened from fire and show evidence of other heat-related damages. <br>The tomb was most recently cleared by the Franco-Egyptian team in 1978-1980, but has been accessible since the time of R. Wilkinson (1828). It was full of bats at the time of E. Thomas' visit in the 1960s, and she attributed the blackening in the tomb to their presence and smoke from prior reuse. The entrance and much of chamber (C) were largely filled with debris at that time.  The tomb was reused in the 26th Dynasty and Roman period as mass burial. <br>The tomb is currently not open to visitation. A modern fired brick doorway with metal door without mesh prevents visitor access. Bats were noted inside in February 2006, 2007, and 2008.

f46472c2-2334-42a2-a754-8a99736ef04d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"QV80, together with QV66 situated next to it, are the two largest tombs in Queens Valley, and have similar plans. QV80 is entered through a steep stepped ramp (A) covered by a concrete arch which leads down into antechamber (C). The entrance and first door (B) are partially rebuilt with fired brick and cement mortar, and five wooden posts and two beams have been installed to  support the ceiling in the antechamber (C). Two lateral chambers (K) and (M) are situated on either side of (C). On axis with the tomb entrance, ramped corridor (E) leads to lower pillared burial chamber (G) with bench hewn from the rock wall. The four pillars were reconstructed sometime between 1974 and 1981 (based on CEDAE photographic evidence) using modern fired-brick. Two small side chambers (O) and (Q) are situated on either side of the southern end of chamber (G), and a niche (I) lies to the north, on axis. <br>QV 80 is located on the north side of the wadi, in the middle part of the valley, the surface of which is composed of a large colluvial debris fan. It is excavated into the upper part of Member I, which contains abundant salt minerals. A number of open joints and two fault planes in chambers (C) and (G) are present in the tomb, often filled by salt, that traverse the rock of the tomb from east to west. A large chert concretion present in the ceiling of chamber (G) adjacent to the NW pillar indicates a large fault zone. <br>The walls in this tomb are fairly flat as it was excavated out of compact marl and therefore very little subsequent packing was required. However, the walls were roughly cut and still required a thick layer of plaster before the final decoration. <br>Areas of raised relief painted plaster survive throughout much of the tomb though only in a very fragmentary state.  These surviving areas have lost most of their paint layer and the surface is blackened from fire. <br>Although recorded by R. Hay of Linplum (1826) and K. R. Lepsius (1844), the tomb entrance was reburied by the time of E. Schiaparelli, and rediscovered and excavated by the Franco-Egyptian team in 1972-76. Many original Pharaonic finds as well as vestiges of later occupation were recovered. E. Thomas relies on the notes of Hay and Lepsius for its description and probable location.  Hay relates the form and layout of the tomb to those of KV and notes only parts of two figures in the 'highest relief', which he says are of the best quality in the valley. Hay also records the presence of plaster destroyed by fire, and the broken pillars, presumably in chamber (G). <br>Currently the tomb is not open to visitation. Substantial bat presence was noted and significant quantities of crystalline bat urine and bat feces have been observed and the resulting odor is strong. The tomb entrance is closed by a metal grid door covered with wire mesh that was covered with plastic sheeting by the SCA in November 2008 to prevent bats from entering (prior to this there was a small gap between the top of the door and the surround). There are also many insect nests covering the surfaces of the tomb.",Primary,,,,,,,,,access point,Chamber Tomb,REIGN OF RAMESES II,,,,,,,,,,,,QV 80,Primary,,"QV 80 is located on the north side of the wadi, in the middle part of the valley.",,/files/uploadedfiles/QV80_TMP_drawing_3.jpg,Archaeological Site Element,,GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (32.59253611058423 25.72794491966814)),-1279~/-1212~,Built Date,,,,,,
