No other cities made a bid to host these Olympics. Held during the worldwide Great Depression, many nations and athletes were unable to pay for the trip to Los Angeles. Fewer than half the participants of the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam returned to compete in 1932.",Primary,,Processing ID,HSEV-00001,1932-07-30,,,,1932 Olympic Games,Primary,,,,

69d2ee0d-1271-432d-8448-a13cf2eceaff,,,,,,"The Case Study Houses were experiments in American residential architecture sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine, which commissioned major architects of the day, including Richard Neutra, Raphael Soriano, Craig Ellwood, Charles and Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig, Eero Saarinen, A. Quincy Jones, and Ralph Rapson to design and build inexpensive and efficient model homes for the United States residential housing boom caused by the end of World War II and the return of millions of soldiers.The program ran intermittently from 1945 until 1966. The first six houses were built by 1948 and attracted more than 350,000 visitors. While not all 36 designs were built, most of those that were constructed were built in Los Angeles, and one was built in Phoenix, Arizona. Of the unbuilt houses #19 was to have been built in Atherton, in the San Francisco Bay Area, while #27 was to have been built on the east coast, in Smoke Rise, New Jersey. A number of the houses appeared in the magazine in iconic black-and-white photographs by architectural photographer Julius Shulman.",Primary,,Processing ID,HSEV-00006,1945-01-01,,,,Case Study Program,Primary,,,,

Ballerini conducted annual campaigns until 1906 on behalf of the Turin Museum, leading to the discovery of new tombs: of the 19th dynasty (QV 36 & QV 66); of the 20th dynasty (QV 55, QV 44, & QV 43); of the 18th dynasty (QV 46, QV 47, QV 30, & QV 87); in the Valley of the Three Pits (QV 89, QV 90, & QV 91); and in the Valley of Prince Ahmose (QV 88). They identified hermit shelters, photographed an observation post between Valley of the Rope and Valley of the Three Pits, and cleared tombs known previously (QV 51 & QV 52). The mission assigned a new numbering system to all the known tombs in the valley, which is still in use today. In 1906, Schiaparelli excavated the Sanctuary to Ptah and Meretseger and Deir er-Rumi.",Primary,,,,1903-01-01,,,,Italian Archaeological Mission Investigation,Primary,,,,
