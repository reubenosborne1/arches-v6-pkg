He has defined QV as comprising the main wadi as well as several ancillary valleys, namely the Valley of Prince Ahmose, the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The cultural boundary coincides with the lower portion of the topographic drainage basin that flows into the main wadi as well as the parking area at the QV entrance.<br>The primary concentration of historic features is in the main wadi, where ninety-one pharaonic-era tombs have been numbered. At the western end of the main wadi, during torrential rains the valley of the Grand Cascade feeds a waterfall and pools of water at the Grotto Cascade, which was held sacred during the pharaonic era, and has been suggested to be the reason for the creation of a royal necropolis at this location. Below this feature are the remnants of a pharaonic-era dam apparently built to prevent flooding of tombs. From the pharaonic era the main wadi also includes remains of structures inhabited by workmen who created the tombs. Behind a rocky spur on a slope between the Valley of the Rope and the Valley of the Three Pits are the ruins of Deir er-Rumi, a small monastery of the Coptic period built on the site of a Roman sanctuary and incorporating a pharaonic tomb (QV 95). <br>Immediately to the south, the main wadi is flanked by the small Valley of Prince Ahmose with, at its foot, two shaft tombs (QV 88, where Prince Ahmose was buried, and QV 98) dating back to the beginning of the New Kingdom and, on its heights, traces of several Coptic-era shelters of anchorites and hermits. <br>The Valley of the Rope, located north of the main wadi, was named for a rope that in the past hung from a cliff at the height of the valley and is thought to have been from the Coptic era. Within this valley's upper eastern branch are tombs QV 92, QV 93, and QV 97. <br>To the northeast of the main wadi is the Valley of the Three Pits. In its lower reaches are eleven tombs, mostly dating to the Thutmosid period, identified by the letters A through L. In the eastern branch of its upper reaches are three shaft tombs (QV 89, QV 90, QV 91) for which the valley was given its name. <br>To the east of the main wadi is the Valley of the Dolmen. In this valley was an ancient trail that workmen from Deir el-Medina traversed to construct tombs at Queens Valley. Along this path is a rock-cut sanctuary dedicated by tomb workmen to Ptah and Meretseger. In this valley's upper part is a natural rock formation named the Dolmen and a structure made of stacked and standing stones called the Menhir, both of which were inhabited during the New Kingdom. <br>Remnants of what have been interpreted as pharaonic era observation posts for personnel providing for the security of tombs have been found on the ridge between the Valley of the Dolmen and the Valley of the Three Pits, as well as on the saddle along the ridge between the Valley of the Rope and the Valley of the Three Pits.

The first Chinatown, centered on Alameda and Macy Streets (now Cesar Chavez Avenue), was established in 1880. Reaching its heyday from 1890 to 1910, Chinatown grew to approximately fifteen streets and alleys containing some two hundred buildings. It boasted a Chinese Opera theater, three temples, a newspaper and a telephone exchange. But laws prohibiting most Chinese from citizenship and property ownership, as well as legislation curtailing immigration, inhibited future growth. From the early 1910s Chinatown began to decline. Symptoms of a corrupt Los Angeles discolored the public's view of Chinatown; gambling houses, opium dens and a fierce tong warfare severely reduced business in the area. As tenants and lessees rather than outright owners, the residents of Old Chinatown were threatened with impending redevelopment, and as a result the owners neglected upkeep of their buildings. Eventually, the entire area was sold and then resold, as entrepreneurs and developers fought the area. After thirty years of decay, a Supreme Court ruling approved condemnation of the area to allow for construction of a major rail terminal, Union Station. Residents were evicted to make room for Union Station, causing the formation of the New Chinatown.",Primary,,,,,,Processing ID,,ARK-00002,,Archaeological District,,,,Current,,,,,,,Site of Los Angeles' Former Chinatown,Primary,,,,,,,/files/uploadedfiles/CHINATOWN1.jpg,Archaeological Site,GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (-118.23525 34.05515)),1880-01-01,Start Date,,,,,,,,

The period of significance is 1962 to 1966, when all of the residences were constructed.\nAlthough these parcels were first subdivided in 1927, the challenge posed by their size and hillside topography appears to have discouraged development for several decades, as the land remained unimproved until the 1960s. At that time, the subdivision was developed by the Stone Fisher Construction Company, with homes designed by renowned Modern architect Richard Neutra and structural engineer Art Levine. Promotions of the tract showcased Neutra as 'one of the world's foremost architects,' as well as the uniqueness of the tract, which offered 'a limited number' of homes 'for aware people.' Describing Neutra's designs for the subdivision, Sherman Oaks architect Jerry L. Pollak said Neutra 'fit the site, he didn't fight it.' Pollack described that Neutra 'wanted his houses to fit in with nature, for the trees in the canyon to grow under and around them. He didn't dig into the hillside or put in big retaining walls.'\nThis collection of platform houses has been featured in the Los Angeles Times on several occasions. In 1997, a reporter focused on the district as an example of the property type itself, writing that approximately 1,500 stilt houses had 'accumulated on the hillsides of Los Angeles from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s.' In the mid- to late-1960s, changing building regulations, among other factors, contributed to a decline in construction of platform houses. Still intact, the Platform House Residential Historic District remains as one of Los Angeles's most unique and cohesive examples of how engineering innovations were harnessed for modern hillside development.",Summary of Significance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sugar Hill Historic District is also significant as an enclave of grand residences constructed in styles of the Arts and Crafts mode, many of which were designed by noted architects of the era.  There are 26 buildings within the district boundaries; of these, 20 (approximately 76%) are contributors to the historic district. The period of significance is 1901 to 1969, from the date of construction of the first residence to the date of construction of the last last contributing building, the First A.M.E. Church.\nSugar Hill was initially developed as West Adams Heights in the early 20th century.  West Adams Heights was an exclusive enclave where prominent members of the Los Angeles community built large, single-family homes. The general West Adams area, which included neighborhoods to the north and south of W. Adams Blvd. traveling west of Figueroa, was an enclave of high-end residential development from the 1890s to the 1920s.  The first residence constructed in the Sugar Hill Historic District was the Rindge Mansion, built on a hill north of Adams Blvd. in 1901.  The West Adams Heights enclave sprung up around it shortly thereafter.  Residents included ranchers, bank presidents, insurance executives, and mining engineers.\nLike many neighborhoods of wealthy, white residents across the United States, the deeds in West Adams contained restrictions that prohibited non-white residents from purchasing or inhabiting homes.  The movement to end racial restrictions in the West Adams area began in 1938 when Norman Houston, president of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, the largest African American-owned business in California, purchased a home in West Adams Heights at 2211 S. Hobart Blvd.  Other wealthy African Americans, including actresses Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniel, also purchased homes in the neighborhood, which became known as Sugar Hill.  (The name Sugar Hill is often applied to wealthy African American areas, likely in reference to the wealthiest part of Harlem, New York.)  In 1945, the West Adams Heights Improvement Association filed a lawsuit arguing that white homeowners who sold their homes to African Americans violated deed restrictions.  The African American homeowners hired Loren Miller, a prominent civil rights attorney, and sued for their right to own and occupy homes in Sugar Hill. The Supreme Court eventually ruled that such restrictions were legally unenforceable.  Other cases originating from Sugar Hill and the West Adams area would eventually result in the Supreme Court's determination that the deed restrictions were unconstitutional.  Later, the Sugar Hill area became the headquarters for African-American businesses and institutions, including Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company and the First A.M.E. church.",Summary of Significance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
